  "question": "A vehicle commences motion from rest under constant acceleration of $5  \\text{m/s}^2$ for $10  \\text{s}$ using the kinematic relation $v = u + at$ with $u = 0  \\text{m/s}$; employing the resultant scalar quantity as the initial velocity $u$ for the subsequent phase, calculate the stopping distance when decelerating constantly at $a = -5  \\text{m/s}^2$ to rest via $v^2 = u^2 + 2as$ where $v = 0  \\text{m/s}$, ensuring all motion adheres strictly to constant acceleration constraints without external assumptions.",

      "reasoning": "The solver's answer (250 m) matches the expected 250 because v = u + at gives 50 m/s after acceleration and v² = u² + 2as with u = 50 m/s and a = -5 m/s² yields s = 250 m. Units are consistent in SI, so the calculations are correct and the answers agree."
