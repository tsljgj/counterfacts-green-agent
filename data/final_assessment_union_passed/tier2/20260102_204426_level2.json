  "question": "Determine the somatic chromosome count $ s $ for an individual exhibiting three copies of a single autosome type while maintaining standard diploid pairing for all remaining chromosomes, given that typical diploid somatic cells comprise 23 chromosome pairs (22 autosome pairs and one sex chromosome pair); utilizing $ s $ and the constraints that 21 diploid autosome pairs contribute 21 chromosomes and sex chromosomes contribute one chromosome to gametes in maximum-count scenarios, compute the maximum chromosome count in gametes when the aberrant autosome type contributes two copies.",
