      "reasoning": "Both answers agree because the solver used the correct Heisenberg-based method and obtained 13.60 eV, which matches the expected value within reasonable rounding tolerance (exact value 13.605693 eV). A minor ambiguity about whether the ratio is rounded before or after squaring can yield 13.60 or 13.61 eV, but either representation is acceptable, so the results agree."
