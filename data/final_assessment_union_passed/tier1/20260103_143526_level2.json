  "question": "Determine the foundational constitutional amendments proposed by the First United States Congress during the presidency of the individual recognized as the first president of the United States under the office established by the U.S. Constitution ratified in 1788, then identify the most prominent opposition leader whose demands originated from Virginia's 1788 ratification convention and directly compelled Congress to formalize these amendments during the inaugural federal Congress session following ratification, ensuring the solution corresponds uniquely to the historical figure documented as leading anti-federalist efforts that precipitated the amendments' proposal in 1789.",
