  "question": "Okay, let me tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to create a new, difficult exam question based on the old one about Margaret Thatcher being the UK's first female Prime Minister. The new question should lead to \"Argentina\" as the answer, which relates to the Falklands War during her leadership.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. The new question must be standalone—no references to prior questions or solutions. It has to embed the old question indirectly so the solver must first figure out that Margaret Thatcher is the answer to the old question, then use that to find Argentina as the opposing nation in the Falklands War.\n\nLooking at the New Environment, the constants are empty, but the derived variables (DEVs) include facts about the Falklands War and Argentina's role. According to the rules, DEVs can't be stated explicitly. So I can't mention that the conflict was the Falklands War or that Argentina invaded. Instead, I need to present just enough information (CEVs) so that once the solver knows it's Thatcher, they can look up or deduce the opposing nation.\n\nThe Expansion Steps mention that the solver needs to identify the primary opposing nation in the most significant military conflict under Thatcher's leadership. The challenge is to phrase this without giving away that it's the Falklands War or Argentina. But I have to include CEVs as given conditions. Wait, the New Environment's constants are empty, so all the given info has to be inferred through the question setup.\n\nWait, the CEVs vs DEVs: The New Environment has constants as empty, so all the derived variables are DEVs. That means none of the details about the Falklands War can be stated. So the question must present a scenario where the solver has to know that Thatcher was PM, then recall or derive which conflict happened under her, then identify the opposing nation.\n\nBut how to structure the question without leaking DEVs? The question must say something like: \"Determine the primary opposing nation in the most significant military conflict initiated under the leadership of the individual who was the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\" But that's too direct and might let someone guess without solving the first part. However, according to the rules, the solver must first solve the old question (get Thatcher), then use that to find the nation.\n\nWait, but the problem is that if the question just says \"the first female Prime Minister of the UK\", the solver would answer Thatcher, then need to know which conflict. But the question needs to force three steps: solve for Thatcher, then disambiguate which conflict (since Thatcher had multiple events), then get Argentina.\n\nBut how to make it so that without knowing it's Thatcher, the conflict part is ambiguous? For example, if the question refers to \"the most significant military conflict initiated under [the result of the first part]\", but the solver must first get Thatcher.\n\nThe key is to phrase the question so that the reference to the first part is abstract, like \"the individual identified as the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\" and then ask for the opposing nation in the major conflict during their tenure.\n\nBut according to R2, I can't describe A_old (Margaret Thatcher) as \"the country\" or \"the person\", but since it's a person, maybe \"the referenced individual\" is okay.\n\nWait, R2 says: \"You must not explicitly state, describe, label, categorize, or reveal the nature of A_old (e.g., “the country,” “the chemical,” “the person,” “the theorem,” “the city,” etc.).\" So I can't say \"the person\" or \"the individual\". Hmm, tricky.\n\nWait, the example in R2 lists \"the country,\" \"the chemical,\" etc., as forbidden. So for a person, saying \"the individual\" might be considered revealing the nature. So instead, use \"the result\" or \"the quantity\", but since it's a person, \"the result\" is abstract.\n\nWait, the instructions say: \"When referencing A_old, use abstract/general nouns such as “the result,” “the quantity,” “the referenced entity,” “the determined value,” “the identified item,” etc.\"\n\nSo for Margaret Thatcher, which is a person, referring to it as \"the referenced entity\" or \"the determined value\" (though value is odd for a person) might be okay. But maybe \"the identified individual\" is still problematic because it specifies individual. Wait, the rule says don't reveal the nature, so \"individual\" might be revealing that it's a person. So better to use \"the result\" even though it's a person. Maybe in context, it's acceptable.\n\nSo the question needs to first have the solver find the first female PM (Thatcher), then use that result to find the opposing nation in the major conflict under her leadership.\n\nThe problem is structuring the question so that it's clear that you need to first get that result, then apply it to find the nation. But without referencing prior parts.\n\nThe template says: Sentence 1 embed Q_old compactly, define intermediate reference. Sentence 2 state CEVs and new task in terms of that reference.\n\nBut in this case, the CEVs from New Environment are empty. Wait, looking back: New Environment constants is empty, derived has dev_0 to dev_3. So CEVs are none? But that can't be. Wait, perhaps the CEVs are the parts that need to be stated as given. Wait, according to 2) CEVs vs DEVs: CEVs are facts that must appear in the question; DEVs are derived by solver.\n\nIn the Expansion Steps, NEW_STEP_0 says since ground truth is Thatcher, identify the opposing nation in the conflict under her leadership.\n\nNEW_STEP_1 mentions Falklands War triggered by Argentina's invasion.\n\nNEW_STEP_2 confirms Argentina was the sole nation.\n\nBut according to the problem, CEVs are the given conditions that must be in the question. Since constants in ENV_new is empty, perhaps there are no CEVs? But that can't be, because otherwise how does the solver know what conflict to look for?\n\nWait, maybe the CEVs are implied by the new task. For example, the question must state that there was a significant military conflict during the tenure of the first female PM, but without specifying details. But according to the rules, CEVs must be included. Wait, perhaps the CEVs here are the fact that there was a significant military conflict under her leadership. But how to state that without revealing DEVs.\n\nWait, the Expansion Steps mention \"the most significant military conflict initiated under Margaret Thatcher's leadership\". So perhaps the CEV is that there was a significant military conflict during her term, which is a given condition.\n\nBut in the New Environment, constants is empty, so maybe the CEVs are not in the constants but derived from the problem. Hmm, maybe I need to infer CEVs based on S_new.\n\nLooking at S_new: Step 0 says \"identify the primary opposing nation in the most significant military conflict initiated under her leadership\". So the CEVs would be that there was such a conflict, and it's the most significant one. But how to phrase that as a given without leaking DEVs.\n\nWait, the CEVs must be stated in the question. So the question should say something like: \"Given that the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom initiated a significant military conflict during her tenure, determine the primary opposing nation in that conflict.\"\n\nBut wait, \"initiated a significant military conflict\" might be a CEV. However, according to the problem, the CEVs are parts of ENV_new. Since ENV_new's constants is empty, perhaps there are no CEVs, which can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the CEVs here are the details that are necessary for the problem but not derived. For example, the fact that the conflict is the most significant one during her leadership. But since the solver has to look that up, maybe that's a DEV.\n\nThis is confusing. Let's re-examine the definitions.\n\nCEVs: Facts/assumptions/given conditions that must appear explicitly in the final question. They define the problem setting and are “given,” not derived.\n\nDEVs: Any facts/conditions/identities that a solver would discover only by solving, searching, coding, or reasoning.\n\nIn the Expansion Steps, Step 0 says \"identify the primary opposing nation in the most significant military conflict initiated under her leadership.\" So \"the most significant military conflict initiated under her leadership\" is a condition that's part of the problem statement—it's a given that such a conflict exists and is the most significant. So that phrase would be a CEV, because it's defining the problem setting. However, the specific name of the conflict (Falklands War) or the opposing nation (Argentina) are DEVs.\n\nTherefore, the CEV here is that there was a most significant military conflict initiated under the leadership of the first female PM of the UK. So the question must state that such a conflict exists and is the most significant one during her tenure.\n\nBut how to phrase it without being too specific. The question could say: \"Determine the primary opposing nation in the most significant military conflict initiated during the tenure of the individual who served as the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\"\n\nBut wait, according to R2, I must not reveal the nature of A_old. Since A_old is a person, referring to \"the individual\" might be revealing. So instead, use \"the result of identifying the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\".\n\nWait, the rule says use abstract nouns like \"the result\", \"the quantity\", etc. So perhaps: \"Using the result of determining the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, identify the primary opposing nation in the most significant military conflict initiated under that leadership.\"\n\nBut \"that leadership\" refers back, which is okay as long as it's not revealing the nature. However, \"leadership\" implies it's a person, which might be a problem. The rule says not to describe the nature, so saying \"leadership\" might hint that A_old is a person. Hmm.\n\nAlternative: \"Using the determined value from identifying the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, find the primary opposing nation in the most significant military conflict initiated during the period corresponding to that result.\"\n\nBut \"period corresponding to that result\" is awkward. Maybe better to use a placeholder.\n\nFollowing Section 2.5 for open-domain retrieval: prefer noun phrases. So \"the identified leader\" but that reveals it's a leader. Wait, the rule says avoid \"the person\", etc. So maybe \"the referenced entity\".\n\nSo: \"Determine the primary opposing nation in the most significant military conflict initiated during the tenure corresponding to the referenced entity identified as the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\"\n\nBut \"referenced entity\" is abstract. However, the problem is that the solver needs to first solve for the entity (Thatcher), then use that to find the nation.\n\nNow, checking R1: the solver must implicitly solve Q_old to get A_old, then use it for A_new. So the question must require knowing who the first female PM was, then using that to find the opposing nation.\n\nThe challenge is to phrase it so that without knowing it's Thatcher, the conflict part is ambiguous (since other PMs might have conflicts), but once you have Thatcher, it's specific.\n\nThe key is that the phrase \"most significant military conflict initiated under [her leadership]\" is unique to Thatcher's term. For example, the Falklands War is the major conflict during her time.\n\nBut to satisfy R4 (unique solvability), we need to ensure that once you know it's Thatcher, there's only one answer. So the question must specify that it's the most significant one, which for Thatcher is the Falklands War.\n\nNow, for the Limiting Phrases (LPs). Need to add constraints that only narrow down after knowing A_old. For example, if someone doesn't know it's Thatcher, \"most significant military conflict\" could refer to many things, but once you know it's Thatcher, it's the Falklands.\n\nBut the question must not leak. So phrasing like \"the most significant military conflict initiated under the leadership resulting from the identification of the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\" – but that's wordy.\n\nWait, the Composition Template says:\n\nSentence 游戏副本: Embed Q_old compactly, define intermediate reference.\n\nSentence 2: State CEVs as givens, new task in terms of reference.\n\nSentence 3: Add LPs if needed.\n\nSo:\n\n\"Determine the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; subsequently, identify the primary opposing nation in the most significant military conflict initiated during the tenure associated with this result, ensuring the nation was the sole direct military adversary of the United Kingdom in that conflict.\"\n\nBut \"ensuring the nation was the sole...\" might be a LP. However, according to R2, we must not state DEVs. \"Sole direct military adversary\" is from dev_2, which is a DEV, so we can't state that. Oops.\n\nAh, right. DEVs must not appear. So \"sole direct military adversary\" is a DEV (from dev_2), so we can't include that in the question. So the LP can't mention that it's the sole nation. But then, how to ensure uniqueness? Because without that, maybe other nations were involved, but in reality, it's just Argentina.\n\nWait, the New Ground Truth is Argentina, and according to dev_2, Argentina was the sole nation. So if the question doesn't specify \"sole\", could there be other answers? For example, if someone thought France was involved (they weren't), but historically, it's only Argentina.\n\nBut to ensure uniqueness, the question needs a LP that after knowing it's Thatcher's conflict, the answer is unique. However, stating \"sole\" would leak, so maybe the LP is implied by \"primary opposing nation\"—assuming that there's one primary.\n\nBut according to the rules, LPs should be conditional filters. So perhaps the phrase \"primary opposing nation\" is sufficient, as in the conflict, there's one main opponent.\n\nBut the problem is making sure that without knowing the conflict, the solver can't guess, but once they know it's Thatcher's time, they can find it's Argentina.\n\nSo the question should be:\n\n\"Determine the primary opposing nation in the most significant military conflict initiated during the tenure of the individual identified as the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, considering only conflicts where the United Kingdom was defending its overseas territories.\"\n\nWait, but \"defending its overseas territories\" might be a CEV? Or is that a DEV? In dev_1, it says the Falklands War was triggered by Argentina's invasion of the Falkland Islands (a British Overseas Territory). So if I include \"defending its overseas territories\", that might hint towards the Falklands, which could allow someone to guess without knowing it's Thatcher. For example, if they know the Falklands War involved defending an overseas territory, they might answer Argentina without going through Thatcher.\n\nSo that would be leaking, which is Failure Mode B.\n\nThus, the LP must not include details about overseas territories. Instead, rely on \"most significant military conflict\" during her tenure.\n\nBut how to ensure uniqueness. For Thatcher, the Falklands War is the most significant conflict during her term. So if the question says \"the most significant military conflict\", that should uniquely point to Falklands, hence Argentina.\n\nSo the question could be:\n\n\"Identify the primary opposing nation in the most significant military conflict initiated under the leadership corresponding to the result of determining the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\"\n\nBut \"leadership corresponding to the result\" is a bit awkward. Using Section 2.5, for open-domain, use noun phrase: \"the identified leader\" but can't say \"leader\". So \"the determined entity\".\n\nWait, the rule says for open-domain, prefer noun phrases like \"the referenced person\", but we can't specify \"person\". So \"the referenced entity\".\n\nSo: \"Determine the primary opposing nation in the most significant military conflict initiated during the period associated with the referenced entity identified as the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\"\n\nBut \"referenced entity\" is abstract. However, this might be acceptable.\n\nNow, checking word count and structure. Needs to be 1-4 sentences, ≤180 words.\n\nAnother angle: Combine both steps into one sentence.\n\n\"Using the identity of the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, determine the primary opposing nation in the most significant military conflict initiated during her premiership.\"\n\nBut \"her premiership\" reveals it's a female person, which might be hinting. The rule says not to reveal the nature of A_old. Since A_old is a person, using \"her\" leaks that it's a female person, which is part of the old question (first female PM), but the old question's answer is a person, so maybe \"her\" is okay because the old question already states \"female Prime Minister\", so the solver knows it's a woman. Wait, but the new question must not reference the old question. Wait, no—the new question has to embed the old question's problem.\n\nWait, the new question must include the old problem as part of it. So the new question would state: \"Who was the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and what was the primary opposing nation in the most significant military conflict initiated under their leadership?\"\n\nBut that's two questions, and the instructions say it must be a single question where you need the first answer to get the second. Also, the format must be one paragraph, 1-4 sentences.\n\nBut according to R1, the solver must implicitly solve Q_old first. So the question shouldn't ask both; it should require the first to answer the second.\n\nSo the correct structure is to have the second part depend on the first, but not explicitly state it as two parts.\n\nThus: \"Determine the primary opposing nation in the most significant military conflict initiated during the tenure of the individual who served as the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\"\n\nThis sentence embeds the old question implicitly: to answer, you must first know who that individual is (Thatcher), then know the conflict under her.\n\nBut does this sentence by itself require solving the old question? Yes, because you need to know who the first female PM was to then find the conflict during her tenure.\n\nThis seems to fit. Now, check against the rules.\n\nR1: Must solve Q_old (who was first female PM) to get A_old (Thatcher), then use to compute A_new (Argentina). Yes.\n\nR2: Does not state A_old or describe its nature beyond \"the individual who served as...\". The phrase \"individual\" might be revealing it's a person, but the old question already says \"Prime Minister\", which is a person, so maybe it's unavoidable. However, the rule says not to use \"the person\", etc. But here, it's part of the embedded question. Wait, the embedded part is restating Q_old, which is allowed.\n\nWait, Section 0 says the question must not reference prior questions, but it can embed the old subproblem. So restating \"the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\" is okay because it's part of the new question's setup.\n\nR2 violation would be if we say \"using the person identified as...\" but here it's \"the individual who served as...\", which is just part of the question's phrasing, not referencing a prior answer.\n\nWait, the rule is about not revealing the nature of A_old in the context of it being the result of a prior step. Since this is a standalone question, there is no prior step; the solver has to do both parts in one go. So the question is self-contained: it asks for the nation based on the first female PM's conflict.\n\nBut the problem is that the question as phrased (\"Determine the primary opposing nation... of the individual who served as the first female Prime Minister...\") requires the solver to first figure out who that individual is, then the nation. So it's a two-step process within one question.\n\nThis should satisfy R1.\n\nNow, check for DEVs. The phrase \"most significant military conflict\" is a CEV because it's given that such a conflict exists and is the most significant during her tenure. The specifics of the conflict (Falklands War, Argentina's role) are DEVs and not stated.\n\nLPs: To ensure uniqueness, maybe add \"where the United Kingdom was the defending party\" but that might leak. Alternatively, since for Thatcher, there's only one major conflict (Falklands), the phrase \"most significant\" suffices.\n\nBut to guarantee uniqueness, perhaps add a LP like \"considering conflicts occurring between 1979 and 1990\" (Thatcher's term), but that might help someone narrow down without knowing it's Thatcher. However, the years are a CEV? If included, it's a given condition.\n\nWait, the New Environment constants are empty, so adding years would be introducing a CEV not in ENV_new. But according to the problem, CEVs must be parts of ENV_new. Since ENV_new constants is empty, perhaps no CEVs are to be added, but that can't be.\n\nWait, looking back at New Environment:\n\n{\n  \"constants\": {},\n  \"derived\": {\n    \"dev_0\": \"...\",\n    ...\n  }\n}\n\nSo constants is empty, meaning there are no CEVs to include. Therefore, the question shouldn't add any extra given conditions beyond what's necessary from the derived steps.\n\nBut the question must include CEVs, which are supposed to be the given conditions. If constants is empty, perhaps there are no CEVs, which would mean the only given is the embedded Q_old part.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe in this case, the CEVs are none, and the entire setup is based on the embedded question.\n\nSo the question is simply asking for the nation based on the first female PM's major conflict, with no additional givens.\n\nBut to ensure uniqueness (R4), we need to make sure that once you know it's Thatcher, there's only one answer. The phrase \"most significant military conflict\" should be sufficient, as the Falklands War is widely regarded as the major conflict during her term.\n\nNow, check word count. The sentence \"Determine the primary opposing nation in the most significant military conflict initiated during the tenure of the individual who served as the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\" is about 20 words. Well under 180.\n\nBut does this question have exactly one answer? Yes, Argentina.\n\nBut could someone argue another conflict? Under Thatcher, there was the Gulf War, but she wasn't PM during the main conflict (she resigned in 1990, Gulf War was 1991). The Falklands War in 游戏副本 is the major one.\n\nSo the question as phrased should lead uniquely to Argentina once you know it's Thatcher.\n\nNow, check R2: Does it reveal the nature of A_old? The phrase \"individual who served as the first female Prime Minister\" does specify it's a person, but since the question is about a Prime Minister, which is inherently a person, this is unavoidable and not considered a leak. The anti-hint rule is about not labeling the result of a prior step (e.g., if this were part two, saying \"using the person from part one\"), but since it's standalone, referencing \"the first female Prime Minister\" is part of the question's premise.\n\nTherefore, this should comply.\n\nBut wait, the rule says: \"You must not explicitly state, describe, label, categorize, or reveal the nature of A_old (e.g., “the country,” “the chemical,” “the person,” “the theorem,” “the city,” etc.).\"\n\nIn this case, A_old is \"Margaret Thatcher\", a person. The question says \"the individual who served as...\", which uses \"individual\" (a synonym for person). Is this considered revealing the nature?\n\nThe example given in R2 includes \"the person\" as forbidden. So using \"individual\" might be equivalent and thus forbidden.\n\nAh, this is a critical point. So the question cannot refer to A_old as a person, country, etc. But in this case, the question is inherently about a person (Prime Minister), so how to phrase it without indicating it's a person?\n\nThis seems impossible, but the rules must be followed. The instructions say to use abstract nouns like \"the result\" or \"the referenced entity\".\n\nSo instead of \"the individual who...\", say \"the result of identifying the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\".\n\nThus: \"Determine the primary opposing nation in the most significant military conflict initiated during the period corresponding to the result of identifying the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\"\n\nNow, \"result\" is abstract and doesn't reveal it's a person.\n\nBut \"period corresponding to the result\" is a bit awkward. Alternatively, \"under the leadership associated with the determined value from identifying the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\"\n\nBut \"leadership\" again implies a person. Hmm.\n\nSection 2.5 for open-domain says to use noun phrases like \"the identified film\", etc. So perhaps: \"the referenced administration\" but \"administration\" might imply it's a government, hence a person's term.\n\nWait, the rule says for open-domain, prefer noun phrases instead of math variables. So \"the identified government leader\" but that reveals it's a leader.\n\nThis is tricky. The key is to refer to A_old without categorizing it. Since A_old is a person, but we can't say \"person\", the solution is to use a neutral phrase like \"the entity\" or \"the result\".\n\nSo: \"Using the entity identified as the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, determine the primary opposing nation in the most significant military conflict initiated under that entity's governance.\"\n\nBut \"entity's governance\" is odd for a person, but complies with not revealing it's a person.\n\nAlternatively: \"Determine the primary opposing nation in the most significant military conflict initiated during the timeframe associated with the result obtained from identifying the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\"\n\nThis avoids categorizing the result.\n\nNow, checking if this meets all requirements.\n\nR1: Yes, must first identify the PM (get Thatcher), then find the nation.\n\nR2: Uses \"result\" and \"timeframe associated with the result\", no categorization.\n\nR3: CEVs—since constants are empty, no CEVs to include. The question doesn't add any DEVs.\n\nR4: Unique solvability—assuming that \"most significant military conflict\" during Thatcher's term uniquely identifies Falklands War vs Argentina.\n\nR5: Three steps: 1) solve for PM, 2) lookup major conflict under her, 3) identify opposing nation.\n\nWord count: approx 25 words. Well under limit.\n\nSentence structure: One sentence, which is acceptable (1-4 sentences).\n\nCheck for banned phrases: No \"prior solution\" etc.\n\nNow, verify with the composition template.\n\nSentence 1: Embed Q_old compactly (\"identifying the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\"), define intermediate reference (\"the result\").\n\nSentence 2: State new task in terms of reference (\"Determine the primary opposing nation... timeframe associated with the result\").\n\nNo LPs needed since uniqueness holds.\n\nThis should be compliant.\nDetermine the primary opposing nation in the most significant military conflict initiated during the timeframe corresponding to the result of identifying the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, considering only conflicts where the United Kingdom deployed military forces in defense of its sovereign interests without coalition partners.",
