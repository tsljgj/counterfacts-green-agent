      "reasoning": "The solver performed the calculation correctly; the expected and solver answers represent the same value with different precision (9.635425216×10²⁴ vs 9.635425×10²⁴), the solver having rounded to 6 significant figures. The relative difference is only 0.00000224%, so the discrepancy is negligible and the answers agree."
