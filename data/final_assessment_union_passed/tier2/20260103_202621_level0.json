      "reasoning": "The solver's answer matches the expected answer by confirming the IHO was founded on June 21, 1921 as the International Hydrographic Bureau, and multiple authoritative sources corroborate this. The question is ambiguous because it could also refer to the 1970 renaming to International Hydrographic Organization, and the solver provided the fuller historical context."
