  "question": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to generate a new, difficult exam question based on the given inputs, following strict anti-hint rules. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the old question and ground truth. The old question asked for the author of \"The Universe Around Us\" and then using the birth year to identify the landmark physics achievement (Edison's phonograph). The old ground truth is \"Thomas Edison's phonograph\".\n\nNow, the new ground truth is \"Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville's phonautograph\". The expansion steps show that the new question should focus on the predecessor to Edison's phonograph - the phonautograph invented by Scott de Martinville.\n\nLooking at the derived variables in ENV_new, I see that DEV_15 explicitly states the answer: \"The direct technological predecessor that inspired Edison's phonograph and served as the first sound recording device was Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville's phonautograph\". But according to the rules, I can't include this as a DEV in the question. \n\nThe CEVs (Constant Environment Variables) seem to be minimal since the \"constants\" field in ENV_new is empty. But actually, from the derived variables, I need to identify what must be given as facts. The key CEVs would be:\n- The author of \"The Universe Around Us\" is James Hopwood Jeans (since this is necessary to get birth year 1877)\n- But wait - I can't state this directly! The anti-hint rules forbid revealing A_old (which was about Edison's phonograph). \n\nAh, this is tricky. The new question must force the solver to first solve the old problem (find Jeans as author, get 1877 birth year), then realize that in 1877 Edison invented the phonograph, but now we need the predecessor to that. \n\nThe critical insight from expansion steps is that the phonautograph (1857) was the direct predecessor. But I mustn't leak this. The question must only say: \"using the landmark achievement from that year [1877], identify its direct technological predecessor...\"\n\nNow for anti-hint compliance:\n- Can't mention \"phonograph\" or \"Edison\" explicitly (would reveal A_old)\n- Must refer to the old result abstractly: \"the landmark achievement\" or \"the referenced invention\"\n- The birth year (1877) must be obtainable only through solving the author part\n\nStructure planning:\nSentence 1: Embed the old subproblem - ask for author of book, then birth year. But must not say \"then use that year for...\" directly. Instead: \"Determine the author of *The Universe Around Us*, and using the year of that author's birth, identify the singular landmark achievement in applied physics from that year described as the first practical device for recording and reproducing sound; state both the inventor's full name and the invention name.\" Wait no - that's the old question! \n\nAh, here's the extension: The new question should take the output of that (which is \"Thomas Edison's phonograph\") and then ask for its predecessor. But I can't state what that output is. So:\n\n\"Determine the author of *The Universe Around Us*, and using the year of that author's birth, identify the singular landmark achievement in applied physics from that year described as the first practical device for recording and reproducing sound; then, referencing that achievement's direct technological predecessor which lacked sound reproduction capability but established the foundational principle of mechanical sound recording, state both the inventor's full name and the invention name.\"\n\nBut this leaks too much - \"lacked sound reproduction capability\" is a DEV (from dev_11). \n\nBetter: \"then, referencing that achievement's direct technological predecessor which enabled visual transcription of sound waves without playback functionality, state both...\"\n\nBut \"visual transcription\" might be too specific. Let's check dev_11: \"The phonautograph was the first machine capable of transcribing sound waves using a horn and stylus to trace vibrations onto lampblack-coated surfaces without playback capability\"\n\nThe key non-leaky descriptor would be: \"which captured sound waveforms visually but could not reproduce audible sound\"\n\nIs this a DEV? Yes - but the rule says DEVs must not appear explicitly. However, the limiting phrase section says LPs should be conditional filters that only work after knowing A_old. \n\nIf I say \"the predecessor that captured sound waveforms visually\", someone might guess phonautograph even without knowing A_old (1877/phonograph). But actually, without knowing it's related to 1877 phonograph, this descriptor alone has multiple possible answers? Probably not - phonautograph is uniquely known for that. \n\nAlternative approach: The LP must be vague enough alone but precise with context. \"the earliest sound recording device that served as the conceptual foundation for the landmark achievement\" - but \"conceptual foundation\" might leak from dev_12.\n\nFrom dev_15: \"direct technological predecessor that inspired Edison's phonograph\". But \"inspired Edison's phonograph\" leaks A_old.\n\nThis is tough. Let's reframe: The only safe LP is one that references the achievement's year indirectly. But the achievement is from 1877, predecessor is 1857.\n\nPerhaps: \"then, for the inventor of that achievement, identify the earliest contemporary device that recorded sound through mechanical vibration tracing on surfaces, crediting its creator's full name and invention.\"\n\nBut \"contemporary\" is wrong - 1857 isn't contemporary to 1877 Edison.\n\nAfter multiple iterations, the safest LP seems to be: \"which established the principle of mechanical sound recording but did not enable audio playback\"\n\nThis is factual (per history) but doesn't uniquely identify phonautograph without context - other devices like magnetic wire recorders came later but also had recording without playback? Actually phonautograph is the only major one that did visual-only recording. But the LP must not leak.\n\nChecking uniqueness: If someone knows the phonograph's predecessor is phonautograph, they'll answer correctly. If they don't, they might guess \"graphophone\" or something, but graphophone was playback-capable. The key differentiator is \"no playback\" - which is unique to phonautograph in this context.\n\nBut the rule says LPs should only narrow down after A_old is known. Before knowing it's phonograph-related, \"mechanical sound recording without playback\" could point to phonautograph, but is that too leaky? Perhaps, but it's the minimal necessary constraint.\n\nFinal structure:\n- Sentence 1: Embed old subproblem (author + birth year -> landmark achievement)\n- Sentence 2: \"Then, referencing the direct technological predecessor of that achievement which enabled mechanical sound recording through waveform transcription without audio reproduction capability, state both the inventor's full name and the invention name.\"\n\nWord count check: ~40 words. Need to verify standalone integrity - no reference to prior anything.\n\nAlso must include all CEVs. What are CEVs here? The book title \"*The Universe Around Us*\" is a CEV. The description \"first practical device for recording and reproducing sound\" is from old question but must be included as it's part of the embedded subproblem.\n\nWait, the old question's description is necessary for the solver to correctly identify the achievement as phonograph (not telephone etc.). So it must be included verbatim in the embedded part.\n\nRevised draft:\n\"Determine the author of *The Universe Around Us*, and using the year of that author's birth, identify the singular landmark achievement in applied physics from that year described as the first practical device for recording and reproducing sound; then, referencing the direct technological predecessor of that achievement which mechanically transcribed sound waveforms without enabling audio playback, state both the inventor's full name and the invention name.\"\n\nCheck anti-hint: \n- \"that achievement\" refers to the old result without naming it (good)\n- \"mechanically transcribed sound waveforms without enabling audio playback\" is the LP - is this a DEV? Yes, but as an LP it's allowed if it only becomes useful after knowing it's phonograph-related. Without context, it might point to phonautograph, but arguably the combination with \"from that year\" (1877) makes the predecessor search meaningful.\n\nCheck R5: \n(i) solve embedded subproblem (author -> birth year 1877 -> phonograph)\n(ii) disambiguation: knowing it's phonograph, look for its predecessor with no playback\n(iii) computation: recall it's phonautograph by Scott de Martinville\n\nWord count: 50 words - well under 180.\n\nFinal check: No banned phrases, standalone, one paragraph, 2 sentences.\nDetermine the author of *The Universe Around Us*, and using the year of that author's birth, identify the singular landmark achievement in applied physics from that year described as the first practical device for recording and reproducing sound; then, referencing the direct technological predecessor of that achievement which mechanically transcribed sound waveforms without enabling audio playback functionality, state both the inventor's full name and the invention name.",
