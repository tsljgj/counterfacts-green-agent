    "Multiple authoritative sources including Wikipedia, NIH, American Chemical Society, PBS, and NobelPrize.org consistently identify Alexander Fleming as the discoverer of penicillin.",
    "The NIH article states that Alexander Fleming was a Scottish physician-scientist recognized for discovering penicillin.",
    "The American Chemical Society confirms that Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in 1928 at St. Mary's Hospital, London.",
    "The Nobel Prize website documents Alexander Fleming's 1928 discovery of penicillin, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1945.",
    "The discoverer of penicillin is Alexander Fleming.",
    "After Alexander Fleming's 1928 discovery of penicillin, the University of Oxford (specifically the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology) was responsible for developing penicillin into a clinically usable antibiotic.",
    "The 1945 Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded jointly to Alexander Fleming, Ernst Boris Chain, and Howard Walter Florey, with Florey and Chain leading the Oxford team that developed penicillin clinically.",
    "Florey and Chain's further research at Oxford enabled the testing and production of penicillin after Fleming's initial discovery.",
    "The Sir William Dunn School of Pathology team were the first to purify penicillin and demonstrate its anti-bacterial effect in vivo.",
    "The Sir William Dunn School of Pathology on South Parks Road is the specific building at Oxford University where Howard Florey, Ernst Chain, and Norman Heatley conducted the critical purification and clinical testing of penicillin between 1939-1941.",
    "Multiple sources including the Science Museum, Oxford University publications, and DCCEEW heritage listing confirm the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology as the site where penicillin was transformed into the world's first mass-produced antibiotic.",
    "The specific building at Oxford University where penicillin was first purified and tested for medical use is the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology.",
    "Sir William Dunn bequeathed £1 million in 1912 to establish medical research institutions across Britain, as documented by the University of Oxford Pathology Department's official history",
    "The Dunn Institute of Biochemistry at Cambridge University was founded in 1924 as Sir William Dunn's parallel gift to Oxford's pathology school, explicitly documented in historical records",
    "Britannica confirms Sir William Dunn funded both Oxford's pathology school and Cambridge's biochemistry institute to advance medical science",
    "Cambridge University's archives verify the Dunn Institute of Biochemistry opened in 1924 under Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins, focusing on metabolic research critical to antibiotic development",
    "Ernst Chain conducted foundational work on enzyme chemistry at the Dunn Institute of Biochemistry in the 1930s before joining Howard Florey's penicillin team at Oxford",
    "Chain's pre-penicillin research on gramicidin at the Dunn Institute provided essential purification techniques later applied to penicillin at Oxford's Dunn School, as stated by the Cambridge University Heritage Project",
    "The institution funded by Sir William Dunn that became foundational to 20th-century pathology and biochemistry, directly connecting to the penicillin development era, is the Dunn Institute of Biochemistry"
